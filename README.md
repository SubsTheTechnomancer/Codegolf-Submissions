
# Codegolf-Submissions
All submissions I have made to [Code Golf](https://code.golf/) in various languages. Note that I do not use encoding tricks in my submissions so my ranking is only concerned with bytes (which will be identical to chars).
# Currently In Progress:

# Usage Notes
Use requirements.txt to check for any changes for this file.<br>
Use the command `git config core.hooksPath hooks` to assign `hooks\pre-commit` as a hook of this repository (otherwise this README will break!)<br>
Don't commit too fast or too many times at once since the hooks web scrap for rank (which might ratelimit your IP).<br>
